## Hello Im Michael Rusu ✌

Everyday, I get to create awesome experiences and engage with the vibrant GitHub developer community. I've run many hackathons, and am an accomplished MC, speaker, and facilitator :microphone:. You'll often catch me at an event or speaking on stage! Well, not so much at the moment, but you'll probably find me on a live stream instead!
