## Hello Im Michael Rusu ✌


Everyday, I get to create awesome experiences and engage with the vibrant GitHub developer community. I've run many hackathons, and am an accomplished MC, speaker, and facilitator :microphone:. You'll often catch me at an event or speaking on stage! Well, not so much at the moment, but you'll probably find me on a live stream instead!

### Some Fun Facts about me:
:zap: I've founded a few companies in the past. I love playing video games which you'll find over on my [Twitch Channel](http://twitch.tv/MishManners). On my channel, I also do live coding! I'm super into sports, including lots of outdoors adventures like hiking, snowboarding, and wakeboarding. You'll probably run into me at an event, but for now, follow me online, jump in on my Twitch chats, or chat me at a virtual conference!

## GitHub Stats

If you haven't had a chance to check out [GitHub Skyline](https://skyline.github.com/) yet, do it now. It's a 3D visualisation of your contribution graph. You can view the graphic, make a video, download the STL file, and even view it in Virtual Reality. You can also view the ASCII file and if you know the code combination, you can view the Konami code (コナミコマンド).

As for the charts 🥧, if you like my A+ stats, then you can make your own by checking out the [GitHub Readme Stats Repo](https://github.com/anuraghazra/github-readme-stats) and [🔥 GitHub Readme Streak Stats](https://github-readme-streak-stats.herokuapp.com/demo/).

### Watch my contribution graph get eaten by the snake 🐍

<!-- platane/snk works, it just puts it on a new branch -->
